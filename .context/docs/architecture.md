# Architecture Notes

Describe how the system is assembled and why the current design exists.

## System Architecture Overview

Summarize the top-level topology (monolith, modular service, microservices) and deployment model. Highlight how requests traverse the system and where control pivots between layers.

## Architectural Layers
- *No architectural layers detected.*

## Detected Design Patterns
- *No design patterns detected yet.*

## Entry Points
- *No entry points detected.*

## Public API
- *No public API detected.*

## Internal System Boundaries

Document seams between domains, bounded contexts, or service ownership. Note data ownership, synchronization strategies, and shared contract enforcement.

## External Service Dependencies

List SaaS platforms, third-party APIs, or infrastructure services the system relies on. Describe authentication methods, rate limits, and failure considerations for each dependency.

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

Summarize architectural decisions, experiments, or ADR outcomes that shape the current design. Reference supporting documents and explain why selected approaches won over alternatives.

## Diagrams

Link architectural diagrams or add mermaid definitions here.

## Risks & Constraints

Document performance constraints, scaling considerations, or external system assumptions.
